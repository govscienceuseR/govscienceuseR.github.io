<div id="introduction" class="section level3">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Understanding the policy that goes into science is important…<br />
Sarewitz Cairney - supply demand mismatch, inability of technical
solutions to resolve political controversies</p>
<p>However, it can be a tedious task… Koontz looks in depth at 12 plans,
1,104 references across them, but these include all kinds of sources:
scholarly, articles, organizations, agencies at different levels, etc.
Desmaris and Herd (2014) 102 Regulatory Impact Assessments, describing
1,378 scholarly citations, and though recognizing the significant
presence of non-scholarly citations, they do not anylze those</p>
</div>
<div id="method" class="section level3">
<h3>Method</h3>
<p>This is vignette walking through the steps of the R packages in the
<code>govscienceuseR</code> tool set: <code>referenceExtract</code>,
<code>referenceClassify</code>, <code>indexBuild</code>, and
<code>referenceSearch</code>. Together, these four packages allow
researchers to go from PDF documents to a data frame of indexed
citations in only a handful of steps in the R coding language. The goal
of these tools is to allow researchers working with various types of
policy documents to analyze citations using a systematic and
reproducible approach.</p>

<div id="the-case" class="section level3">
<h3>The case</h3>
<p>Sustainable Groundwater Management Act… The data we’ll be using are
documents for California’s Groundwater Sustainability Plans. These
documents are Groundwater Sustainability Agency-level plans, developed
in response to the state’s Sustainable Ground Management Act. Passed in
2014, SGMA has required that GSAs (‘Agencies’) develop plans to meeting
various sustainability goals for groundwater, including… As such, these
documents provide a useful case for evaluating the use of science in
policy, as there are a variety of…</p>

<div id="getting-started" class="section level3">
<h3>Getting started</h3>
<div id="installations" class="section level4">
<h4>Installations</h4>
<p>Let’s get started by downloading all four packages from the <a
href="https://github.com/govscienceuseR">govscienceuseR GitHub
page</a>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install_github(&quot;govscienceuseR/referenceExtract&quot;)
devtools::install_github(&quot;govscienceuseR/referenceClassify&quot;)
devtools::install_github(&quot;govscienceuseR/referenceBuild&quot;)
devtools::install_github(&quot;govscienceuseR/citationSearch&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then load these, and dependent packages, into library. [<strong>Note:
All of the dependent packages required should be imported when we load
in these packages, but they currently aren’t</strong>]. You may be
prompted to install some of the dependent packages if you do not already
have them, such as <code>keras</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(referenceExtract)
library(referenceClassify)
library(referenceBuild)
library(citationSearch)
packs = c(&#39;data.table&#39;, &#39;dplyr&#39;, &#39;stringr&#39;, &#39;keras&#39;, &#39;tensorflow&#39;,
          &#39;tidyr&#39;, &#39;purrr&#39;)
sapply(packs, require, character.only = T)</code></pre>
<p>You’ll also need to install <a
href="https://solr.apache.org">Solr</a> for the final step of the
process.</p>
<p><br> #### Data</p>
<p>The data we’ll be using are documents for California’s Groundwater
Sustainability Plans. These documents are available publicly to download
from <a
href="https://ucdavis.box.com/s/9m3dogbibkrwy01pg4sdwouhzl8i6sef">Box</a>.
Feel free to download them to your computer to a file that will be
considered your document directory. There are 114 plans, which total
over 160,000 pages. We will set our document directory to this folder of
PDFs.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>doc_directory &lt;- &quot;~/Box/reference_classifier/documents_gsp/&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Using these GSP documents we’ll be walking through the following
steps of the process:</p>
<p><img src="img/workflow.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="referenceextract" class="section level3">
<h3>1. <code>referenceExtract</code></h3>
<p>The <code>referenceExtract</code> package from govscienceuseR is
designed to take unstructured PDF documents, feed them through the <a
href="https://anystyle.io/">anystyle.io</a> citation extraction
software, and return tagged citation data in a tabular format.</p>
<p><br> #### <code>reference_extract()</code></p>
<p>The first step of extracting references is to input PDF documents
into the <code>reference_extract()</code> function. This function reads
in every PDF in the document directory (doc_dir), and runs them through
anystyle.io. Anystyle extracts probable citations and exports them to
the reference directory (ref_dir) as JSON files. Depending on the number
and size of files, this can take some time. For example, these 114
documents took over an hour to extract.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Extract probable citations from PDF documents and convert them to .json files
ref_directory &lt;- &quot;data/ref_dir&quot;
reference_extract(doc_dir = doc_directory, 
                 ref_dir = ref_directory, 
                 layout = &quot;none&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><br> #### <code>reference_compile()</code></p>
<p>Next, the <code>reference_compile()</code> function transforms the
JSON files into tabular data and compiles them all in one data table,
adding the file name as an identifier.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Compile json files into a singular tabular data table
dt &lt;- reference_compile(ref_directory)</code></pre>
<p>After these first two steps we can take a look at our probable
citations according to the Anystyle software. Initially, there are 26528
probable citations across these 114 documents.</p>

<p>It is noticeable above that the data provided by Anystyle has its
challenges for further analysis. The first is a related to data
structure: authors are nested into matrices, some rows (such as the
date) have multiple listed values, etc., all of which make the data hard
to analyze. For example, here is what seems to be two probable citations
combined into one observation:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>unnest(dt[204, c(2,3)])</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3 × 2
##   date  title                                                                                
##   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;

## 2 2015  Progress Report: Subsidence in the Central Valley, California. For Department of Wat…
## 3 2009  Ground‐water availability in California’s Central Valley</code></pre>
<p>The second challenge is related to quality: many of the probable
citations are not sensible. The Anystyle software seems sensitive to
multiple formats like numbers and short-form sentences, such as
addresses, resulting in false positive identification of references. For
example, here is an address listed as a probable citation from our
data:</p>

<p><br> #### <code>reference_clean()</code></p>
<p>To try to address the challenges in these probable citations, the
<code>reference_clean()</code> function goes through a series of steps.
For each column the function unlists the data and filters out unlikely
candidates for that column. For instance, if a number listed in the date
column does not match any reasonable date format or expectation, it is
removed. If a string in the URL column actually resembles a DOI, it is
moved to that column. And so on. Furthermore, if there seem to be
multiple citations listed in one row that can be broken apart in
parallel across all of the columns, we unnest these rows. (Note:
depending on the size of the files this function may take some time.
Cleaning these 26528 citations takes about 18 minutes).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Unnests list structures into tabular data and filters out low probability refs
dt &lt;- reference_clean(dt)</code></pre>
<p>This cleaning process has changed probable citations now a bit. Some
of the probable citations have been unnested (and therefore expanded)
while others have been removed, leaving us with 14423 probable
citations. Examples of these probable citations are below:</p>

<h3><code>referenceClassify</code></h3>
<p>The <code>referenceClassify</code> package is designed to take a data
frame of tabular, tagged citation data (author, year, container,
publisher, doi, etc), look for exact matches between those tags and
various high-level indices (mainly journal and agency names), and begin
to classify probable citations into these high-level categories. These
indices are 1:) an index of academic journals from the <a
href="https://rdrr.io/github/ikashnitsky/sjrdata/man/sjr_journals.html"><code>sjr</code>
package</a> relying on the <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/">Scimago
database</a>, 2) an index of academic conference papers/proceedings also
from the Scimago database, 3) and an index of US state and federal
agencies, curated by the package authors. All three of these indices are
built into this package and can be accessed with
<code>data(scimago.j)</code> for journals, <code>data(scimago.c)</code>
for conferences, and <code>data(agencies)</code> for agencies.</p>
<!---
#### `_match()` functions  

Based on our initial cleaning of the GSP data in the previous section, we can see which of these probable citations are exact matches to three different indices: an index of academic journals from the Scimago database, an index of academic conference papers/proceedings also from the Scimago database, and an index of US state and federal agencies, curated by the package authors. We can look for matches using the `journal_match()`, `conference_match()` and `agency_match()` functions.


```r
table(journal_match(dt$container))
```

```
## 
## FALSE  TRUE 
## 13543   880
```


```r
table(conference_match(dt$container))
```

```
## 
## FALSE  TRUE 
## 14420     3
```


```r
table(agency_match(dt$container, dt$author))
```

```
## 
## FALSE  TRUE 
## 13967   456
```
--->
<p><br> #### <code>prepared_by()</code> and
<code>journal_disambig()</code></p>
<p>[<strong>Note: Should these be moved to the cleaning function, or to
the other package?</strong>]</p>
<p>Before classifying our probable references, we can further clean and
refine these potential citations with the <code>prepared_by()</code>
function, which removes commonly-seen lead-ins to references (‘prepared
for/by’, etc.) to improve exact matching.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dt &lt;- prepared_by(dt, x = &#39;container&#39;, y = &#39;author&#39;, z = &#39;publisher&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, we disambiguate the journals with the
<code>journal_disambig()</code> function, which references indices of
common journal abbreviations and through manual cleaning of journals
referenced in transportation documents.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dt$container &lt;- journal_disambig(dt$container)</code></pre>
<p><br> #### <code>regex_classify()</code></p>
<p>Now with probable references as ‘clean’ as possible, we use regular
expressions to classify our data based on exact matches using the
<code>regex_classify()</code> function. This function does two things.
First it looks across all of the columns for exact matches to our
indices, and if there is an exact match, it pulls out that value into a
‘input’ column. If there is no exact match, the value in the input
column will be selected in the following order of preference: doi,
container, publisher, title, author. Second, based on the matches the
function will assign the potential citation into one of four classes:
journal, agency, conference, or none. If none of the potential
citations’ data is an exact match to any of the indices, the
classification is NA.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Extract most descriptive &#39;input&#39; and look for exact match to index 
dt &lt;- regex_classify(dt, &#39;container&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Based on these classifications, we can see the counts of exact
matches, and which ones have not been classified.</p>

<p><br> #### <code>keras_classify()</code></p>
<p>Next we want to classify the probable references that are not exact
matches to any of our indices. To do this, we use
<code>keras_classify()</code> input our probable into a neural network
trained to predict the reference class. To train this model, we used
data from Environmental Impact Statements, classified through both
manual classification and the semi-automated regex classification
explained above.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Use the descriptive &#39;input&#39; to probabilistically identify the reference class
## Note: Need to set this wd right now because I can&#39;t actually get the model object to save within the package itself
setwd(&quot;~/Documents/Davis/R-Projects/referenceClassify/&quot;)
# Something is wrong with the auto_input
predictions &lt;- keras_classify(dt, probability = .85, 
                              &#39;container&#39;, auto_input = F,
                              &#39;training_input&#39;) 
dt &lt;- cbind(dt, select(predictions, predict_class))</code></pre>
<p>Because we ran this model on the whole data frame, we can compare our
regex classification with the Keras classifications to get a sense of
the model performance.</p>

<p>These results, altogether, suggest that the Keras model is 93%
accurate in its prediction of the citations we are able to do exact
matching for. Now, let’s unify the classification columns and have a
look at the total for each estimated grouping.</p>

<p>And we’ll tidy up these data by filtering out the citations
classificied to ‘delete’ (the false positives) in preparation for our
indexing in the next step.</p>

<p><br> #### Interim check in: Journals and agencies from exact
matching</p>
<p>So far, we’ve identified exact matches to our high-level indices
(journal, agency, conference) and then used machine learning to classify
citations that are not exact matches so that we can begin to figure out
their source. At this interim stage, we can take a look at the
high-level classifications across citations, and the journals and
agencies for which we’ve found exact matches.</p>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the high-level matches. A reference list
was required by DWR for GSPs, and indeed we see that all 114 of the
documents have references that we can identify as either a scholarly
journal or agency. Based on our tool’s probabilistic tags, it looks like
the number of references ranges from 1 to 128, with 24 being the average
number of classified references. That average differs between references
classes, whereby the average number of journal references is 16 and the
average number of agency references is twice that, at 32.</p>
<p>Below are the top 15 references journals and agencies identified by
our exact matching strategies.</p>
<p>[<strong>Note: I need to exact match agency</strong>]</p>

<h3><code>indexBuild</code></h3>
<p>Now that we have a general sense of what kind of citation types are
represented within the probable citations, the next step is to try to
index these citations exactly. <br> #### Identify index concepts</p>
<p>First we need to generate an index. The indexBuild function wraps
around the OpenAlex API</p>
<p>First, what are the areas we already have known references from? We
koad in the Scimago database, including journal metdata, to get an
understanding of what journals can be identified through exact
matching.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>themes &lt;- dt_journals %&gt;% 
  select(sourceid, journal_title, cat1:cat15) %&gt;% 
  pivot_longer(cols = cat1:cat15,

               values_to = &quot;cat&quot;) %&gt;%

  mutate(cat = trimws(str_remove_all(tolower(cat),
                                     &#39;\\(miscellaneous\\)|,|-&#39;))) %&gt;%

<p><img src="gsp_vignette_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>keywords &lt;- tidytext::unnest_tokens(themes, word, cat) %&gt;% 
  dplyr::filter(!word %in% tidytext::stop_words$word) %&gt;% 
  mutate(word = textstem::lemmatize_words(word)) %&gt;% 
  unique()</code></pre>
<p>Let’s use these themes and keywords to inform our index creation. I
build in a quick bit of sleep time for querying the concepts from
openAlex, then apply this functions across all of the themes and
keywords existing in the data. (Note: This querying of over 200 concepts
takes ~5 minutes.) <br> #### <code>queryConcepts()</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code>query_slowly &lt;- function(x){
  index &lt;- queryConcepts(concept_string = x, 
                         per_page = 50)
  return(index)
  Sys.sleep(1)
}

<p>Now we have a number of resources representing the concepts from our
existing data. Here is a random look at some of them.</p>

<p>What we end up is a list of concepts, related to which are different
‘works’, or specific citations. We can extract the works from those
concepts below. I currently break this into two extraction rounds, small
and large, because they need to be handled differently. This extraction
